1. **Type Parameters**  
   Generics allow classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on types as parameters, enabling code reuse with different data types.

2. **Stronger Compile-Time Checks**  
   Generics provide better type checking at compile time, reducing runtime errors.

3. **Elimination of Casting**  
   Using generics removes the need for explicit type casting.

4. **Generic Algorithms**  
   Generics support the creation of flexible, type-safe, and readable algorithms that work with various data types.
